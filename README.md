This is an implementation of the method DSCrank for selecting and ranking semantic datasets from catalogues, executing mapping of their data items, delivering this associations to be voted by a crowd (part implemented for web: http://ypublish.info/crowdsourcing-validation/, but configured in the app) and as a final result it does the integration and generates a new version of the source dataset to be interlinked.

Just compile or generate the jar in the IDE to obtain the app.
